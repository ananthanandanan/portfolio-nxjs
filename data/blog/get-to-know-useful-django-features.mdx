# Get to know useful Django features

Django is a powerful web framework that makes it easy to build complex web applications. One of the things that makes Django so powerful is
its ability to handle forms, formsets, inlines, filters, querysets, and templates. In this blog post, we're going to take a closer look at each
of these topics and see how they can be used to build amazing web applications.

## Forms

Forms are the most common way to collect user input in a web application. Django provides a powerful form framework that makes it easy to
create forms and validate user input. In this section, we'll take a look at how to create a simple form and how to validate user input.

### Creating a form

To create a form, we need to create a class that inherits from the `ModelForm` class. The `ModelForm` class is a subclass of the `Form` class.
The `ModelForm` class provides a set of helper methods that make it easy to create forms and validate user input. For example, the `ModelForm`
class provides a `save()` method that saves the form data to the database. The `ModelForm` class also provides a `clean()` method that
validates user input. For example, let's take assume a Model called `User` that has some fields. We can create a form for the `User` model.

```python
from django import forms
from .models import User

class UserForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'email']
```

- The `Meta` class is used to define the model and fields that the form will be based on. You can exclude fields from the form by using the
  `exclude` attribute instead of the `fields` attribute.
- There are other features that can be used to customize the form. For example, you can use the `widgets` attribute to specify the type of
  widget that should be used for each field. You can also use the `labels` attribute to specify the label for each field.
- Furthermore, there are different form fields. For example, the `CharField` is used to represent a text field. The `EmailField` is used to
  represent an email field. The `DateField` is used to represent a date field. The `DateTimeField` is used to represent a date and time field etc.
  Let's take a look at how to use these fields, widgets, labels in our Form.

```python
from django import forms
from .models import User

class UserForm(forms.ModelForm):
    first_name = forms.CharField(label='First Name', max_length=100, widget=forms.TextInput(
        attrs={
            'class': 'form-control',
            'placeholder': 'Enter your first name'
        }
    ))
    last_name = forms.CharField(label='Last Name', max_length=100, widget=forms.TextInput(
        attrs={
            'class': 'form-control',
            'placeholder': 'Enter your last name'
        }
    ))
    email = forms.EmailField(label='Email', widget=forms.EmailInput(
        attrs={
            'class': 'form-control',
            'placeholder': 'Enter your email'
        }
    ))
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'email']
        exclude = ['date_joined']

```

- There are many other fields and widgets that can be used according to the need. You can refer to the
  [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/forms/fields/) for more information.

### How to use the form in a view ?

To use the form in a view, we need to create a view function that takes a request as an argument. The view function should return a response
that contains the form. For example, let's create a view function that returns a form.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import UserForm

def user_form_view(request):
    form = UserForm()
    return render(request, 'user_form.html', {'form': form})
```

- The `render()` function is used to render a template. The `render()` function takes three arguments. The first argument is the request.
  The second argument is the template name. The third argument is a dictionary that contains the context. The context is a dictionary that
  contains the variables that will be available in the template. In this case, the context contains the form variable.
- The `user_form.html` template can be created as follows.

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %}
<form method="POST">
  {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }}
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>
{% endblock %}
```

- The `form.as_p` tag is used to render the form as a paragraph. The `form.as_table` tag is used to render the form as a table. The `form.as_ul`
  tag is used to render the form as an unordered list.
- The `csrf_token` tag is used to render the CSRF token. The CSRF token is used to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. The CSRF token
  is a hidden field that is used to validate the form. The CSRF token is automatically added to the form when the `method` attribute is set to
  `POST`. It's important to add the CSRF token to the form. Otherwise, the form will not be submitted because the CSRF token will not be
  validated. You can read more about CSRF tokens [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/csrf/).

### How to validate user input ?

Now the above `user_form_view` function is used to render the form. However, the form is not used to collect user input. To collect user input,
we need to use the `request.POST` attribute. The `request.POST` attribute is a dictionary that contains the form data. For example, let's
modify the `user_form_view` function to collect user input.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import UserForm

def user_form_view(request):
    form = UserForm()
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UserForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
    return render(request, 'user_form.html', {'form': form})
```

- The `form.is_valid()` method is used to validate user input. If the user input is valid, the `form.save()` method is used to save the form
  data to the database. If the user input is invalid, the `form.errors` attribute is used to get the errors.

- Sometimes, you might want to get the data from the form without saving it to the database. In this case, you can use the `form.cleaned_data`
  attribute. The `form.cleaned_data` attribute is a dictionary that contains the form data. For example, let's modify the `user_form_view`
  function to get the data from the form without saving it to the database.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import UserForm

def user_form_view(request):
    form = UserForm()
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UserForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            first_name = form.cleaned_data['first_name']
            last_name = form.cleaned_data['last_name']
            email = form.cleaned_data['email']
    return render(request, 'user_form.html', {'form': form})
```

> Note: The `form.cleaned_data` attribute is only available if the `form.is_valid()` method returns `True`. And you can only use the
> `get()` method to get the data from the `form.cleaned_data` attribute. For example, `first_name = form.cleaned_data.get('first_name')`.

### How to set initial values for a form ?

Sometimes, you might want to set initial values for a form. For example, let's say you want to create a form that allows users to update their
profile or to help user fill-in less predicatable information, like his birthday which could be taken from the database, we can customize the form
to set the initial values for the fields. For example, let's modify the `user_form_view` function to set the initial values for the form.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import UserForm

def user_form_view(request):
    form = UserForm()
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user = User.objects.get(id=request.user.id)
        form = UserForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
    else:
        form = UserForm(initial={'birth_date': user.birth_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')})
    return render(request, 'user_form.html', {'form': form})
```

- The `form = UserForm(initial={'birth_date': user.birth_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')})` line is used to set the initial value for the `birth_date` field.

> Note: The `request.user` attribute is used to get the current user. The `request.user` attribute is only available if the user is authenticated.
> You can read more about authentication [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/default/).

## Formsets

Formsets are a way to manage multiple forms in a single view. They are particularly useful when you need to handle a large number of forms in a single view.
For example, imagine you have a website that allows users to create a list of items. Instead of creating a separate form for each item, you can use a formset
to handle all of the forms in a single view. Let's take a look at how to use formsets.

### Preparing a formset

Let's say we have the `User` model that we created in the previous section. We want to create a formset that allows users to add his/her social media
accounts. The `User` model has the following fields.

```python
class User(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()
    date_joined = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

- We want to create a formset that allows users to add his/her social media accounts. The `SocialMediaAccount` model has the following fields.

```python
class SocialMediaAccount(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    url = models.URLField()
```

- The `SocialMediaAccount` model has a foreign key to the `User` model. The `user` field is used to store the user that owns the social media account.

What I have to come to use is the `inlineformset_factory` function to create a formset. The `inlineformset_factory` function takes three arguments.
The first argument is the parent model. The second argument is the child model. For example, let's create a formset that allows users to add his/her social media accounts. Let's create a new view called `user_formset_view` in the
`views.py` file.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import UserForm
from .models import User, SocialMediaAccount

def user_formset_view(request):

    UserFormSet = inlineformset_factory(User, SocialMediaAccount, fields=('name', 'url'), extra=1,
    can_delete=False)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UserForm(request.POST)
        formset = UserFormSet(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid() and formset.is_valid():
            user = form.save()
            for form in formset:
                social_media_account = form.save(commit=False)
                social_media_account.user = user
                social_media_account.save()
    else:
        form = UserForm()
        formset = UserFormSet()
    return render(request, 'user_formset.html', {'formset': formset}, {'form': form})
```

### So what's happening here? Let me explain is step by step.

- The `inlineformset_factory` function is used to create a formset. The `inlineformset_factory` function takes three arguments.

  - The first argument isthe parent model.
  - The second argument is the child model.
  - The `extra` argument is used to specify the number of extra forms that will be added to the formset.
  - The `can_delete` argument is used to specify whether the user can delete the forms in the formset.
  - The `fields` argument is used to specify the fields that will be displayed in the formset.

- Then, we check if the request method is `POST`. If the request method is `POST`, we create a `UserForm` instance and a `UserFormSet` instance.

- Then, we check if the `UserForm` instance and the `UserFormSet` instance are valid. If they are valid, we save the `UserForm` instance to the database.
  Then, we loop through the `UserFormSet` instance and save each form to the database.

- If the request method is not `POST`, we create a `UserForm` instance and a `UserFormSet` instance.

- Finally, we render the `user_formset.html` template and pass the `UserFormSet` instance along with the `UserForm` instance to the template.

### What is difference between UserForm and UserFormSet?

When you create a form or formset object and pass it the `request.POST` data,
Django will automatically extract the relevant data from the request and use it to populate the form or formset fields.

For example, when you create a form object using `form = UserForm(request.POST)`, Django will extract the data from the `request.POST` object that corresponds
to the fields in the UserForm, and use that data to populate the form. Similarly, when you create a formset object using `formset = UserFormSet(request.POST)`,
Django will extract the data from the `request.POST` object that corresponds to the fields in the UserFormSet and use that data to populate the formset.

### Creating a formset template

Now that we have created a formset, let's create a template to display the formset. Let's create a new file called `user_formset.html` in the `templates` folder.

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %}
<h1>User Formset</h1>
<form method="POST">
  {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }} {{ formset.management_form }} {% for form in formset %} {{
  form.as_p }} {% endfor %}
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
{% endblock %}
```

So what's happening here? Let me explain is step by step.

- We extend the `base.html` template.
- Then, we display the `UserForm` instance using the `form.as_p` template tag.
- Then, we display the `UserFormSet` management form using the `formset.management_form` template tag.
- Then, we loop through the `UserFormSet` instance and display each form using the `form.as_p` template tag.
- Finally, we display a submit button.

This is a very basic implementation of a formset. You can use the same approach to create more complex formsets.

## Inlines

In django admin, out of the box has a lot of features and it's pretty easy to use. But if you want to customize the admin site, you can do that too.
One of those is the need to add or edit related objects on the same page as the parent object. This is called inlines.

### Creating an inline

Let's use the `User` model and the `SocialMediaAccount` model to create an inline. Assuming we have registered the `User` model and the `SocialMediaAccount` model
in the admin site, let's create a new class called `SocialMediaAccountInline` in the `admin.py` file.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import User, SocialMediaAccount

class SocialMediaAccountInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = SocialMediaAccount
    extra = 1

@admin.register(User)
class UserAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    search_fields = ('first_name', 'last_name', 'email')
    list_display = ('first_name', 'last_name', 'email')
    inlines = [SocialMediaAccountInline]
```

This will add the `SocialMediaAccount` model as an inline to the `User` model in the admin site.

### Different types of inlines

- `StackedInline` - Displays the inline in a stacked format.
- `TabularInline` - Displays the inline in a tabular format.

## Querysets

Querysets are the core of Django's ORM. Querysets allow you to read data from the database, filter data, order data, and much more.
Querysets are lazy. This means that querysets are not evaluated until they are needed. This is a very important concept to understand. So let's dive into it.

### Creating a queryset

Let's play around with just the `User` model just to get a feel for querysets.

- Get all users

```python
from .models import User

users = User.objects.all()
```

- Get a single user

```python
from .models import User

user = User.objects.get(id=1)
```

- Okay so we gave the `get()` method the `id` of the user we want to get. But what if we want to get the user by email? We can do that too.
  Better yet, what if we want to get the user through a mixture of fields? It's possible.

```python
from .models import User

user = User.objects.get(
    first_name='John',
    last_name='Doe',
    created_at__year=2020,
)
```

## Filtering

We could only have limited use of `get()` if we had to get a single user. But what if we want to get multiple users? We can do that too.

To get more fancier and chain different filters, we can use the `filter()` method.

```python
from .models import User

users = User.objects.filter(
    first_name='John',
    last_name='Doe',
    created_at__year=2020,
)
```

### Ordering

We can order the querysets. Ordering is done by passing the field name to the `order_by()` method.

```python
from .models import User

users = User.objects.order_by('first_name')
```

### Limiting

We can limit the querysets. Limiting is done by passing the number of items to the `all()` method. Most often done with slicing.

```python
from .models import User

users = User.objects.all()[:5]
```

### Counting

We can count the querysets. Counting is done by calling the `count()` method. This is very useful when we want to get the number
of items in a queryset.

```python
from .models import User

users = User.objects.count()
```

### Use Q objects

In django we can use `Q` objects to combine filters. Let's see how we can do that.

```python
from django.db.models import Q

# Find all users who have either 'John' as first name or 'Doe' as last name
users = User.objects.filter(Q(first_name='John') | Q(last_name='Doe'))

# Find all users who have 'John' as first name and 'Doe' as last name
users = User.objects.filter(Q(first_name='John') & Q(last_name='Doe'))

# Find all users who have last name 'Doe' but not 'John' as first name
users = User.objects.filter(Q(last_name='Doe') & ~Q(first_name='John'))

# Find all users who have last name 'Doe' or first name 'John' but not both
users = User.objects.filter(Q(last_name='Doe') | Q(first_name='John')).exclude(first_name='John', last_name='Doe')
```

### Use F objects

In django we can use `F` objects to compare fields.

```python
from django.db.models import F

# Find all users whose first name is the same as their last name
users = User.objects.filter(first_name=F('last_name'))

# Find all users whose age is greater than the age of their manager
users = User.objects.filter(age__gt=F('manager__age'))

# Find all users whose age is at least twice the age of their manager
users = User.objects.filter(age__gte=F('manager__age')*2)

# Find all users whose birth date is before their registration date
users = User.objects.filter(birth_date__lt=F('registration_date'))

# Find all users whose last login date is more recent than their registration date
users = User.objects.filter(last_login__gt=F('registration_date'))
```

### Use Q objects and F objects together

We can also use Q objects and F objects together. In very complex queries, this is very useful.

```python
from django.db.models import Q, F

# Find all users whose first name is the same as their last name and their age is greater than 18
users = User.objects.filter(Q(first_name=F('last_name')) & Q(age__gt=18))
```

## Reverse relationships

In django it's pretty straightforward to get objects from parent to child. But what if we want to get objects from child to parent?
There is a way to accomplish that.

Let's use the `User` model and the `SocialMediaAccount` model to get objects from child to parent.

```python
from .models import User, SocialMediaAccount

# Get all social media accounts of a user
user = User.objects.get(id=1)
social_media_accounts = user.social_media_accounts.all()
```

What if we want to get all users of a social media account? There is a method to access attributes of the a parent object from a child object.

Let's consider the example of `Building` and `Room` models. A building can have many rooms. But a room can only have one building.

```python
from .models import Building, Room

# Get all rooms of a building
building = Building.objects.get(id=1)
rooms = building.room_set.all()

# Get the building of a room
room = Room.objects.get(id=1)
building = room.building
```

- But if the relationship is a ManyToManyField, then we can use `through` to get the related objects, or we can use `related_name` to get the related objects.

Let's consider the example of `User` and `Group` models. A user can be in many groups. And a group can have many users.

```python
from .models import User, Group

users = User.objects.filter(name='John', user_groups=g.id)
```

- Here we are using `user_groups` as the `related_name` of the `ManyToManyField` in the `User` model.

> Note: If you want to get the related objects through a ManyToManyField, then you can use `through` to get the related objects,
> or you can use `related_name` to get the related objects.

## Templates

In django we can use templates to render dynamic content. They are very powerful and easy to use. The syntax is very similar to
HTML. It's also called Django Template Language (DTL) it's pretty similar to Jinja2.

Let's go through set up and some basic syntax.

- First we need to create a template file. Let's create a `templates` folder in the root of our project. Then create a `users` folder inside the `templates`
  folder. Then create a `index.html` file inside the `users` folder.

- Then we need to add the `TEMPLATES` setting in the `settings.py` file.

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

> Note: We need to add the `DIRS` setting to tell django where to look for the templates.

- To make use of the templates that we create, we need to create a view. Let's create a `views.py` file in the `users` folder.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import User

def index(request):
    users = User.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'users/index.html', {'users': users})
```

- Then in the `urls.py` file of the `users` app, we need to add the `index` view.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

- In the `index.html` file, we can use the `users` variable that we passed to the template.

```html
{% for user in users %}
<p>{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

### Template tags

In django we can use template tags to do some logic in the template. I won't be covering all the template tags, just the ones that is
commonly used.

- `if` tag

```html
{% if user.age > 18 %}
<p>{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }} is an adult</p>
{% else %}
<p>{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }} is a minor</p>
{% endif %}
```

- `for` tag

```html
{% for user in users %}
<p>{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

- `url` tag

```html
<a href="{% url 'index' %}">Home</a>
```

> Note: We can use the `url` tag to get the url of a view. We need to pass the name of the view as the argument.

- `static` tag

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}" />
```

> Note: We can use the `static` tag to get the url of a static file. We need to pass the path of the static file as the argument. By default django looks
> for the static files in the `static` folder in the root of the project.

- `block` tag

```html
{% block content %}
<h1>Home</h1>
{% endblock %}
```

> Note: We can use the `block` tag to define a block in the template. Every template that extends another template must have a `block` tag.
> If we don't have a `block` tag, then django will throw an error.

- `extends` tag

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}
```

> Pro Tip: Every template could be extended from a `base.html` file.
> This is a good practice. We can use the `block` tag to override the blocks in the `base.html` file.

Let's demonstrate how we can use the `block` and `extends` tags. Remember `block` tag is used to define a block in the template,
which means when a child template extends a parent template, then the child template can override the blocks in the parent template or
add content inside that block thereby extending the parent template.

This is a great way to reuse the code, the child template is able to customize specific parts of the parent template. Without having
to copy the whole template again and again.

- First we need to create a `base.html` file in the `templates` folder. Then we need to add the `block` tag in the `base.html` file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Base</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="{% url 'index' %}">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="{% url 'users:index' %}">Users</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>{% block content %} {% endblock %}</main>
  </body>
</html>
```

- Then we need to create a `index.html` file in the `users` folder. Then we need to add the `extends` tag in the `index.html` file.

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %}
<h1>Home</h1>
{% endblock %}
```

> Note: We need to add the `block` tag in the `base.html` file and the `extends` tag in the `index.html` file.

- This means the `index.html` file extends the `base.html` file. So the `index.html` file will have the content of the `base.html` file and
  it's own content embedded in the `block` tag.

### Template filters

In django we can use template filters to modify the data in the template. I won't be covering all the template filters, just the ones that is
commonly used.

- `date` filter

```html
<p>{{ user.created_at|date }}</p>
```

> Note: We can use the `date` filter to format the date. We can pass the format as the argument.

- `time` filter

```html
<p>{{ user.created_at|time }}</p>
```

> Note: We can use the `time` filter to format the time. We can pass the format as the argument.

- `length` filter

```html
<p>{{ user.first_name|length }}</p>
```

> Note: We can use the `length` filter to get the length of a string.

- There are many other filters that we can use in django. We can check the documentation for more information.

### Django Cache

In the world of web development, caching is a very important topic. Caching is a way to store data in a temporary storage so that we can access it faster.
We need to use caching when we have data that is not changing frequently. For example, if we have a list of users, then we can cache the list of users
so that we don't have to query the database every time we need the list of users. This will improve the performance of our application.

Django provides a very flexible caching system. We can use different caching backends. The integration with the caching system is very easy. We can use
the caching system in our views, templates, models, etc. Let's use `Redis` as the caching backend. Since `Redis` is an in-memory database, it is very fast and
pretty popular in the industry.

- First we need to install `django-redis` and `redis` packages.

```bash
pip install django-redis redis
```

- Then we need to add the `django-redis` package to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in the `settings.py` file.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_redis',
]
```

- Then we need to add the `CACHES` setting in the `settings.py` file.

```python
CACHES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django_redis.cache.RedisCache",
        "LOCATION": "redis://6379",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "CLIENT_CLASS": "django_redis.client.DefaultClient",
        }
    }
}
```

> Note: We need to add the `CACHES` setting in the `settings.py` file. We need to pass the `BACKEND` and `LOCATION` as the arguments.

Let's start using the caching system in our application. We will use the caching system in our `index` view.

- First we need to import the `cache` from the `django.core.cache` module.

```python
from django.core.cache import cache
```

- Then we need to add the `cache` decorator to the `index` view.

```python
@cache_page(60 * 15)

def index(request):
    users = User.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'users/index.html', {'users': users})
```

So what's happening here? We are using the `cache_page` decorator to cache the `index` view. We are passing the `60 * 15` as the argument. This means
the `index` view will be cached for 15 minutes. So if we access the `index` view within 15 minutes, then the view will be served from the cache. If we access
the `index` view after 15 minutes, then the view will be served from the database.

- The next thing we need to do is to add the `cache` tag in the `index.html` file.

```html
{% load cache %}
```

- Then we need to add the `cache` tag in the `index.html` file.

```html
{% cache 60 * 15 users %}
<ul>
  {% for user in users %}
  <li>{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endcache %}
```

So what's happening here? We are using the `cache` tag to cache the `users` queryset. We are passing the `60 * 15` as the argument. This means
the `users` queryset will be cached for 15 minutes. So if we access the `index` view within 15 minutes,
then the `users` queryset will be served from the cache. If we access the `index` view after 15 minutes, then the `users` queryset will
be served from the database.

> NOTE: the purpose of caching in template and view is different. In view, we are caching so that we don't recall the database every time we access the view.
> In template, we are caching so that we don't recall the database every time we access the template, only if the data is not altered.

## Django Pagination

Django provides a very easy way to paginate the data. We can use the `Paginator` class to paginate the data. Let's see how we can use the `Paginator` class
to paginate the data.

- First we need to import the `Paginator` class from the `django.core.paginator` module.

```python
from django.core.paginator import Paginator
```

- Then we need to create a `Paginator` object and pass the `users` queryset and the `per_page` as the arguments.

```python
paginator = Paginator(users, 10)
```

- Then we need to get the `page` number from the `request.GET` dictionary.

```python
page = request.GET.get('page')
```

- Then we need to get the `page` object from the `paginator` object.

```python
page_obj = paginator.get_page(page)
```

- Then we need to pass the `page_obj` queryset to the `render` function.

```python
return render(request, 'users/index.html', {'page_obj': page_obj})
```

- Then we need to add the `page_obj` to the `index.html` file.

```html
{% if page_obj.has_previous %}
<a href="?page={{ page_obj.previous_page_number }}">Previous</a>
{% endif %} {% for page in page_obj.paginator.page_range %}
<a href="?page={{ page }}">{{ page }}</a>
{% endfor %} {% if page_obj.has_next %}
<a href="?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number }}">Next</a>
{% endif %}
```

- Then we need to add the `page_obj` to the `index.html` file.

```html
{% for user in page_obj %}
<li>{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }}</li>
{% endfor %}
```

## Django Filtersets

Django provides a very easy way to filter the data. We can use the `FilterSet` class to filter the data. Let's see how we can use the `FilterSet` class.
This acts more like the detailed search functionality. We can filter the data based on the fields.

- First we need to install the `django-filter` package.

```bash
pip install django-filter
```

- Then we need to add the `django-filter` package to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in the `settings.py` file.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_filters',
]
```

- Then we need to create a `UserFilter` class and inherit the `FilterSet` class.

```python
from django_filters import FilterSet

class UserFilter(FilterSet):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['first_name', 'last_name']
```

- Then we need to add the `UserFilter` class to the `index` view.

```python
def index(request):
    users = User.objects.all()
    user_filter = UserFilter(request.GET, queryset=users)
    return render(request, 'users/index.html', {'user_filter': user_filter})
```

- Then we need to add the `user_filter` to the `index.html` file.

```html
<form action="" method="GET">
  {{ user_filter.form }}
  <button type="submit">Filter</button>
</form>
```

- That is it. Now we can filter the data based on the fields.

## Conclusion

In this post, I have covered some important and useful features of Django, like Django forms, formsets, Django caching, Django pagination, and Django filtersets. I hope you have enjoyed this post.
These are the features I have used throughout my Django projects. I only provided simple examples to get an idea of how these features work.
There are other features like Django signal, messages, logging, etc. When I get to use these features, I will write a post about them.
