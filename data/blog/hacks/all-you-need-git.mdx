# What is Git ?

Git is a powerful tool for version control, and it can be a bit daunting for new users to learn all of its commands
and features. In this blog post, I'll share some Git commands and tips that I've learned through experience that I
think would be particularly beneficial for new users and those who are still learning.

## Git Commands

### git init

The `git init` command is used to create a new Git repository. It can be done in two ways:

1. Create a new directory and navigate into it, then run `git init`.
2. Run `git init` in an existing directory.

```bash
git init
```

### git clone

The `git clone` command is used to obtain a Git repository from an existing URL. It can be done in two ways:

1. Clone a repository into a newly created directory.
2. Clone a repository into an existing directory.

```bash
git clone [url]
```

### git add

The `git add` command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It can be done in two ways:

1. Add a file's changes to the staging area.
2. Add all new and changed files to the staging area.

```bash
git add [file]
git add .
```

### Add or Delete remote git repository url

The way the changes made in a local repository are shared with others is by pushing the changes to a remote repository.
The `git remote` command is used to view the list of remote repositories. And the `git remote add` command is used to add a new remote
repository, while the `git remote remove` command is used to delete an existing remote repository. It's through these assigned url
that the changes made in the local repository are pushed to the remote repository.

```bash
git remote add [remote-name] [url]
git remote remove [remote-name]
```

### Unstage changes

From my experience, I've found that using the `git restore` command is the easiest way to unstage changes.
It can be done in `4` ways:

1. Unstage a single file's changes.
2. Unstage all files' changes.
3. An alternate way to unstage all files' changes, using `--staged` flag.
4. Bonus tip: use `git checkout` to unstage all files' changes.

```bash
git restore [file]
git restore .
git restore --staged .
git checkout .
```

### git commit

The `git commit` command is used to save the changes in the staging area to the local repository.
It can be done in three ways:

1. Commit a file's staged changes.
2. Commit a snapshot of all staged changes.
3. Commit a snapshot of all staged changes, and commit all files that are already tracked.

```bash
git commit -m "[message]"
git commit -a
git commit -am "[message]"
```

### Uncommit changes

This is the part where as a new user, I struggled the most. I've found that using the `git reset` command is the
easiest way to uncommit changes, in different forms.

1. Uncommit most recent commit, keep the changes staged.
2. Uncommit most recent commit, and unstage the changes.
3. Uncommit most recent commit, and unstage the changes, and delete the changes. In short, it's like the commit never happened.

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD^
git reset HEAD^
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

> Note: The `^` symbol is used to refer to the parent of the current commit. If you want to uncommit the second most recent commit, you can use `HEAD^^`.

### Rename commit message

The `git commit --amend` command is used to change the most recent commit's message.

1. Amend the most recent commit's message.

```bash
git commit --amend -m "[message]"
```

> Hack tip => You can also use this command to add new changes to the most recent commit. Just stage the new changes, and run the command.
> This is done in `feature` branches, where you already have made a commit and you wanted to make some changes on top of it.
> For the sake of creating PRs and code reviews, one commit per feature or PR is preferred.

### git push

The `git push` command is used to push the changes in a local repository to a remote repository. If you want to force push the changes,
then you can use the `--force` flag.

```bash
git push [remote-name] [branch]
git push --force [remote-name] [branch]
```

### git status

The `git status` command is used to list all new or modified files to be committed.

```bash
git status
```

### git log

The `git log` command is used to list the version history for the current branch. It can be done in two ways:

1. List version history for the current branch.
2. List version history for the current branch, including all commits from all branches and remotes. In a graph format.

```bash
git log
git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline
```

### Create new branch, switch to it, rename it, and delete it

The `git branch` command is used to create, list, rename, and delete branches. It can be done in `4` ways:

1. Create a new branch.
2. List all branches.
3. Rename a branch.
4. Delete a branch.

```bash
git branch [branch-name]
git branch
git branch -m [old-branch-name] [new-branch-name]
git branch -d [branch-name]
```

- To switch to a branch, use the `git checkout` command.

```bash
git checkout [branch-name]
```

- To delete branch from remote repository, use the `git push` command.

```bash
git push [remote-name] --delete [branch-name]
```

### git Stash

The stash command temporarily stores all the modified tracked files. This comes to use when you have some changes that you don't want to commit immediately
or the feature you add might break the current code. You can stash the changes and then apply them later. This can be done using command:

```bash
git stash
```

- You can also provide a tag to the stash command to identify the stash later.

```bash
git stash save [tag]
```

- To apply the stash, use the `git stash apply` command.

```bash
git stash apply [stash@{0}]
```

- Or you can use the `git stash pop` command to apply the stash and delete it.

```bash
git stash pop [stash@{0}]
```

> Note: The `stash@{0}` is the tag of the stash. If you don't provide any tag, then it will apply the most recent stash. If you want to
> see all the stashes, use the `git stash list` command.

- To delete a stash, use the `git stash drop` command.

```bash
git stash drop [stash@{0}]
```

### Cherry pick

One of the commands that I use the most is the `git cherry-pick` command. It's used to apply the changes introduced by some existing commits.

1. Apply changes introduced by some existing commit, by specifying the commit hash.

```bash
git cherry-pick [commit-hash]
```

This is useful when you want to apply some changes from a branch to another branch. For example, you have a `feature` branch, and you
want to apply some changes from it to the `master` branch.

### Squash commits

This a hell for new users, where they end up with a lot of commits in `feature` branch, and they want to squash them into one commit.
The `git rebase` command is used to reapply commits on top of another base tip.

I use the `git rebase -i` command to squash commits.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~[number-of-commits]
```

- After that a text editor will open up, where you can specify the commits you want to squash. For example,
  if you want to squash the last 3 commits, then you can use `HEAD~3` as the base tip. And then you can specify the commits you want to squash.
  To make it less confusing, I usually use `reword` or `r` for the last commit, and `fix` or `f` for the rest of the commits. These should
  replace the `pick` or `p` in the text editor. After that save it and another text editor will open up, where you can specify the commit message.

### Update local repository with remote repository

This is pretty personal choice, but what worked for me was to use `git fetch` along with `git rebase`, this synergy worked out
for me. The `git fetch` command is used to fetch the changes from the remote repository. And the `git rebase` command is used to
reapply commits on top of another base tip.

```bash
git fetch [remote-name]
git rebase [remote-name]/[branch-name]
```

> I don't prefer using `git pull` or `git merge` because it creates a merge commit, which is not preferred in `feature` branches.

## Submodules

Submodules are used to include another Git repository within a repository. It can be done in two ways:

1. Add a submodule.
2. Update a submodule.

```bash
git submodule add -b [remote-branch] [remote-repository-url]
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

- To clone a repository with submodules use the `--recursive` flag.

```bash
git clone --recursive [remote-repository-url]
```

## Safety Net - Reflog

The `git reflog` command is used to list the commits that were recently checked out. It can be used to recover from mistakes.
This is the last resort, when you have done some dumb action and you want to recover from it.

```bash
git reflog
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts through - ours and theirs

The `git rebase` command is one of the most powerful and verstatile commands in Git. It can be used to reapply commits on top of another base tip, rename commits, squash commits, and handle merge conflicts.

When you have a merge conflict, you can use the `ours` and `theirs` options to resolve the conflict.

1. Use `ours` option to keep the changes from the current branch.
2. Use `theirs` option to keep the changes from the branch being merged.

```bash
git rebase -X ours [branch-name]
git rebase -X theirs [branch-name]
```

How this would work is, when you have a merge conflict, you can use the `ours` option to keep the changes from the current branch, and the `theirs` option to keep the changes from the branch being merged. Its one of those time saving commands, where you don't have to manually resolve the conflicts.

> Note: The `ours` and `theirs` options are used to resolve the conflicts in favor of the current branch or the branch being merged. So use them wisely.
