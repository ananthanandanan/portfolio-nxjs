# File system navigation made fuzzier using fzf-cd command

## Introduction

One of the things that I found really hintering my productivity is the time I spend navigating through the file system. I have been using the `cd` command for a long time and I have been using the `fzf` for a while, in my _neovim_ setup(which is pretty neat by the way). But in my day to day work, I have to navigate through the file system a lot. So I thought why not combine the two and make my life easier. So I did and I am going to share it with you. This will be a quick guide on how to setup the `fzf-cd` command.

## Prerequisites

- `fzf` installed

> If you don't have `fzf` installed, you can follow the [official guide](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to install it.

## Setup

Go to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file and add the following lines at the end of the file.

```bash
# fzf-cd
fcd() {
  local directory
  directory=$(find * -type d 2>/dev/null | fzf +m) && cd "$directory"
}
```

Now, you can either restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to load the changes.

That's it. Now you can use the `fcd` command to navigate through the file system. You can also use the `fcd` command with the `zsh` plugin `zsh-autosuggestions` to make it even more easier.
