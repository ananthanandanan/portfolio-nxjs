In the previous post, we covered how to setup Node project, create expressJS routes for connecting to a MongoDB database and how to create protected routes
that use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. In this post, we will take a look at how to use a wrapper on top of the popular axios
library to easily use these JWT-protected routes in your React application. If you haven't read the previous post, I recommend you do so before
reading this one.

## Challenge with JWT-Protected Routes

One of the challenges of using JWT-protected routes is that the token expires after a certain period of time. This means that your application
will need to handle refreshing the token when it expires, in order to continue accessing protected routes. One way to do this is to create a
`hook` that will use refresh token from client cookie to get a new access token. This is a good solution, but it requires a lot
of manual work to implement and maintain. Another way is to use axios interceptors to automatically refresh the token before the request is sent.
This is the approach we will take in this post.

## Axios Interceptors

Axios interceptors are functions that are called before a request is sent and before a response is received. They are useful for adding
headers to requests, handling errors, and refreshing tokens.

## Creating the Axios Wrapper

We will first create two different axios instances, one for the protected routes and one for the unprotected routes. We will then create a
wrapper that will use the protected axios instance to make requests to protected routes. This wrapper will also handle refreshing the token
before the request is sent if the token has expired.

The axios instances for protected and unprotected routes will be created in a separate file called `api\axios.js`. The protected axios
instance will have the `withCredentials` option set to true, which will allow the client to send cookies to the server.

```js
import axios from 'axios'

const BACKEND_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL
export default axios.create({
  baseURL: BACKEND_URL,
})

export const axiosSecure = axios.create({
  baseURL: BACKEND_URL,
  withCredentials: true,
})
```

## Creating the useRefreshToken Hook

The `useRefreshToken` hook will be used to refresh the token when it expires. It will take the refresh token from the client cookie and use it
to get a new access token. It will then store the new access token in the client cookie or if you are using a state management library like
`Redux`, you can store it there and it returns the new access token as well. We will create a separate file called `hooks\useRefreshToken.js` to
store this hook.

```js
import { useContext } from 'react'
import AuthContext from '../store/auth-context'
import axios from '../api/axios'

const useRefreshToken = () => {
  const authctx = useContext(AuthContext)

  const refresh = async () => {
    const res = await axios.get('/api/refresh', {
      withCredentials: true,
    })
    //Change current state of user
    authctx.setToken(res.data.accessToken)

    return res.data.accessToken
  }
  return refresh
}

export default useRefreshToken
```

## Creating the Axios Wrapper with Interceptors

Now that we have the `useRefreshToken` hook, we can create the axios wrapper. We will create a separate file called `hooks\useAxiosSecure.js` to
store this hook. This hook will use the `useRefreshToken` hook to refresh the token before the request is sent if the access token has expired. It will
send back data from the response if the request is successful.

```js
const useAxiosSecure = () => {
  const authCtx = useContext(AuthContext)
  const refresh = useRefreshToken()

  useEffect(() => {
    const requestIntercept = axiosSecure.interceptors.request.use(
      (config) => {
        if (!config.headers['Authorization']) {
          config.headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${authCtx.accessToken}`
        }
        return config
      },
      (err) => Promise.reject(err)
    )
    const responseIntercept = axiosSecure.interceptors.response.use(
      (response) => response, // if response is 200
      async (err) => {
        // if there is some error
        const sentRequest = err?.config
        if (err?.response?.status === 403 && !sentRequest?.sent) {
          sentRequest.sent = true
          const newAccessToken = await refresh()
          sentRequest.headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${newAccessToken}`
          return axiosSecure(sentRequest)
        }
        return Promise.reject(err)
      }
    )

    return () => {
      axiosSecure.interceptors.response.eject(responseIntercept)
      axiosSecure.interceptors.request.eject(requestIntercept)
    }
  }, [authCtx, refresh])
  return axiosSecure
}

export default useAxiosSecure
```

### Explanation

The axios wrapper uses the `useRefreshToken` hook to refresh the token before the request is sent. It also uses the `useEffect` hook to add
interceptors to the axios instance. The request interceptor adds the access token to the request header if it is not already present. The
response interceptor checks if the response status is 403, which means that the token has expired. If the token has expired, it will call the
`useRefreshToken` hook to refresh the token and then resend the request with the new access token. The `sentRequest` variable is used to make
sure that the request is not sent again if the token has expired.

> Note => `return` method in `useEffect` is used to remove the interceptors when the component unmounts. This is important because if you don't
> remove the interceptors, they will be called every time the component renders, which will cause an infinite loop.

## Using the Axios Wrapper

Now that we have the axios wrapper, we can use it to make requests to protected routes. We will create a separate file called `api\api.js` to
store the axios wrapper. We will also create a separate file called `api\apiRoutes.js` to store the routes for the API.

```js
import axiosSecure from './useAxiosSecure'

const axiosSecure = useAxiosSecure()

let removeCardRes = await axiosSecure.delete('api/list/delete_list/' + tasksId + '/' + boardId)
```

It's that simple! Now you can use the axios wrapper to make requests to protected routes. You can also use the axios wrapper to make requests
to unprotected routes.

## Conclusion

In this post, we learned how to use axios interceptors to automatically refresh the token before the request is sent. We also learned how to
create a custom hook to refresh the token. We then created an axios wrapper that uses the custom hook to refresh the token before the request is
sent. We also learned how to use the axios wrapper to make requests to protected routes. You can find the code for this post on
