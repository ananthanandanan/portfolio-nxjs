# üåê Setting Up Coolify with a Custom Domain and SSL Certificates Using Traefik and Cloudflare: A Comprehensive Guide

Coolify is a powerful self-hosted PaaS that simplifies application deployment, but setting up a custom domain with SSL certificates using Traefik can be tricky. After facing numerous challenges while configuring Coolify with Traefik as a reverse proxy and Cloudflare as the DNS provider, I've written this guide to save you time and frustration. Here, I'll walk you through the issues I encountered, the solutions I implemented, and the final working configuration. üöÄ

## The Challenge: Custom Domain and SSL Setup with Traefik

Coolify uses Traefik as its proxy to handle SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt. My goal was to:

1. Configure a custom domain (`<your-domain>.tech`) with Cloudflare as the DNS provider.
2. Enable wildcard SSL certificates for the domain and its subdomains (e.g., `*.your-domain.tech`).
3. Automate SSL certificate issuance and renewal using Let's Encrypt.

### Key Problems I Faced:

1. **DNS Misconfiguration**:

   - Let's Encrypt returned errors like:
     ```
     acme: error: 400 :: urn:ietf:params:acme:error:dns :: no valid A records found for <your-domain>.tech
     ```
     Despite adding DNS records in Cloudflare, they were not propagating as expected. ‚ùå

2. **Cloudflare API Token Permissions**:

   - The Cloudflare API token initially lacked the correct permissions, causing Traefik to fail during the DNS-01 ACME challenge:
     ```
     acme: error presenting token: Cloudflare: failed to find zone <your-domain>.tech: Zone could not be found
     ```

3. **Conflicting HTTP and DNS Challenges**:

   - Including both HTTP and DNS challenges in Traefik's configuration resulted in unexpected behavior, making certificate issuance fail repeatedly. ‚ö†Ô∏è

4. **Lack of Clear Documentation**:
   - While Coolify provides helpful documentation, piecing together the right configuration for wildcard SSL certificates with Traefik and Cloudflare was a challenge. Well, I would say you have to be observant and understand the documentation well. The wildcard domain, for me at least did not work out of the box; with the default configuration, it would just not work.

## The Solution: A Step-by-Step Guide

Here's the final process I followed to configure the custom domain and SSL certificates successfully. üí°

### 1. **Set Up DNS Records in Cloudflare**

Make sure your domain is managed in Cloudflare and that the DNS records are properly configured:

- **A Records**:
  - `<your-domain>.tech` ‚Üí `<Server IP>`
  - `*.your-domain.tech` ‚Üí `<Server IP>`
- **Proxy Status**: Set both records to **DNS Only** (gray cloud) to allow Traefik to handle SSL.

### 2. **Generate a Cloudflare API Token**

Create an API token in Cloudflare with the following permissions:

- **Zone / DNS / Edit**: Allows Traefik to add DNS TXT records for the DNS-01 challenge.
- **Zone / Zone / Read**: Allows Traefik to read DNS zones.

**Steps**:

1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Navigate to **My Profile > API Tokens > Create Custom Token**.
3. Set permissions as shown below:
   - **Zone / DNS / Edit**
   - **Zone / Zone / Read**
4. Restrict the token to your domain (`<your-domain>.tech`) for added security. üîí

### 3. **Configure Traefik**

Here's the generic Traefik configuration that you can adapt for your own use:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
networks:
  coolify:
    external: true
services:
  traefik:
    container_name: coolify-proxy
    image: 'traefik:v3.1'
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=<Your Cloudflare API Token> # Replace with your API token
    extra_hosts:
      - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'
    networks:
      - coolify
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
      - '443:443/udp'
      - '8080:8080'
    healthcheck:
      test: 'wget -qO- http://localhost:80/ping || exit 1'
      interval: 4s
      timeout: 2s
      retries: 5
    volumes:
      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro'
      - '/data/coolify/proxy:/traefik'
    command:
      - '--ping=true'
      - '--ping.entrypoint=http'
      - '--api.dashboard=true'
      - '--api.insecure=false'
      - '--entrypoints.http.address=:80'
      - '--entrypoints.https.address=:443'
      - '--entrypoints.http.http.encodequerysemicolons=true'
      - '--entryPoints.http.http2.maxConcurrentStreams=50'
      - '--entrypoints.https.http.encodequerysemicolons=true'
      - '--entryPoints.https.http2.maxConcurrentStreams=50'
      - '--entrypoints.https.http3'
      - '--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false'
      - '--providers.file.directory=/traefik/dynamic/'
      - '--providers.file.watch=true'
      - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.dnschallenge.provider=cloudflare' # Use Cloudflare for DNS challenge
      - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.dnschallenge.delaybeforecheck=0'
      - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.storage=/traefik/acme.json'
      - '--providers.docker=true'
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.entrypoints=http
      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.service=api@internal
      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt
      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.tls.domains[0].main=<your-domain>.tech # Replace with your main domain
      - traefik.http.routers.traefik.tls.domains[0].sans=*.your-domain.tech # Replace with your wildcard domain
      - traefik.http.services.traefik.loadbalancer.server.port=8080
      - traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.scheme=https
      - traefik.http.middlewares.gzip.compress=true
      - coolify.managed=true
      - coolify.proxy=true
```

**Key Tips**:

1. Use the **DNS-01 challenge** exclusively. **Do not** include the HTTP challenge (`httpchallenge`). üö´
2. Set `delaybeforecheck=0` to avoid unnecessary delays during DNS validation.

### 4. **Restart and Monitor**

- Restart Traefik and monitor the logs to ensure successful certificate issuance.
- In the Coolify Proxy logs, there won't be any output, this would mean that the certificate is issued successfully.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **DNS Zone Not Found**:

   - Ensure the API token has the correct permissions and is restricted to the specific domain.
   - Verify that the nameservers for your domain point to Cloudflare.

2. **No Valid A Records**:

   - Double-check DNS records in Cloudflare and verify their propagation using [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/).

3. **Invalid API Token**:
   - Regenerate the token with proper permissions and update the `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` in your configuration.
