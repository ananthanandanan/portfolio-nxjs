Are you tired of using structured databases like MySQL and SQLite? Want to try something new and exciting? Look no further than MongoDB! In this blog post,
we'll be setting up a backend using Express.js and MongoDB.

I will be using the project that my team worked on, called lazzzy-space, as an example. You can find the source code for the project on GitHub.

# Basics information about Express.js and MongoDB

## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It is a cross-platform, open-source database that stores data in JSON-like documents.
It is a non-relational database, which means that it does not use tables and rows to store data. Instead, it uses collections and documents.

## What is Express.js?

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set
of features for web and mobile applications.

## Setting up MongoDB Atlas Cluster

Now that we have installed the required packages, we need to set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster. MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service
that hosts MongoDB databases. It is a cloud-based database service that is free to use for small projects. To set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster,
go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for an account. Once you have signed up, you will be
taken to the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Click on the "Build a Cluster" button to create a new cluster.

</div>

On the next page, you will be asked to select a cloud provider and region for your cluster. Select the cloud provider and region of your choice and
click on the "Create Cluster" button.

# Creating a Node.js project

Once you have those installed, let's create a new project directory and initialize it as a Node.js project. In your terminal, navigate to the directory
you want to create the project in and run `npm init -y`. This will create a `package.json` file, which is essential for managing your project's dependencies.

## Setting up Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose

First, we need to install Express.js and MongoDB. We'll also be using Mongoose, which is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

```bash
npm install express mongoose mongodb
```

## Create an env file

Now that we have set up our MongoDB Atlas cluster, we need to create an env file. Create a file called ".env" in the root directory of your project.
In this file, we will store our MongoDB connection string. Paste the connection string you copied from MongoDB Atlas into the .env file.

```bash
MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-connection-string>
```

## Creating the Express.js server

Now that we have installed the required packages, we can create our Express.js server. Create a file called `server.js` in the root directory of your project.
To use the .env file we created earlier, we need to install the dotenv package. Run `npm install dotenv` to install the package. Now, we can import the
dotenv package into our server.js file.

And for cookies, we will be using the cookie-parser package. Run `npm install cookie-parser` to install the package. Now, we can import the cookie-parser
package into our server.js file.

```js
const express = require('express')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
require('dotenv').config()
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')

const app = express()
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000

app.use(express.json())
app.use(cookieParser())

//Listen through PORT only if mongoDB connection is `open`
mongoose.connection.once('open', () => {
  console.log('Connected to MongoDB')
  app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`))
})
```

## Connecting to MongoDB

To connect to our MongoDB cluster, we will create a file called `config\db.js` in the config directory of our project. In this file, we will connect to our MongoDB
cluster using the connection string we stored in our .env file. We will also be using the mongoose package to connect to our MongoDB cluster.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URI, {
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
      useNewUrlParser: true,
    })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
  }
}

module.exports = connectDB
```

Now, we need to import the `connectDB` function into our `server.js` file and call it. This will connect to our MongoDB cluster.

```js
const connectDB = require('./db')

connectDB()
```

- Another two files that I have we have used `config\allowedOrigins.js` and `config\corsOptions.js` which are used to allow CORS and to set the allowed origins.

So in `allowedOrigins.js` we have

```js
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://www.yoursite.com',
  'http://127.0.0.1:5000',
  'http://localhost:3500',
  'http://localhost:3000',
]

module.exports = allowedOrigins
```

And in `corsOptions.js` we have

```js
const allowedOrigins = require('./allowedOrigins')

const corsOptions = {
  origin: (origin, callback) => {
    if (allowedOrigins.indexOf(origin) !== -1 || !origin) {
      callback(null, true)
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'))
    }
  },
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200,
}

module.exports = corsOptions
```

> Note: You can add more origins to the `allowedOrigins` array. This will provide a list of origins that are allowed to access your API. Which is
> important for security reasons.

- Import these to `server.js` file

```js
const corsOptions = require('./config/corsOptions')
const allowedOrigins = require('./config/allowedOrigins')

app.use(cors(corsOptions))
```

- These layers of extra functions are called `middleware`. They are functions that have access to the request and response objects. They can be used to
  modify the request and response objects before they are sent to the client. We will be using the `cors` package to enable CORS in our Express.js
  server. Run `npm install cors` to install the package. Now, we can import the cors package into our server.js file.

- Another example of middleware that we have used earlier were the `express.json()` and `cookie-parser` packages. These packages are used to parse the
  request body and cookies respectively.

## JWT Authentication for APIs

To take this to the next step, we will be adding JWT authentication to our API. This will allow us to authenticate users and restrict access to certain
routes. We will be using the `jsonwebtoken` package to create and verify JWTs. Run `npm install jsonwebtoken` to install the package.

We will create a `middleware\verifyJWT.js` file in the middleware directory of our project. In this file, we will create a middleware function that will verify
the JWT sent in the request header. If the JWT is valid, the user will be allowed to access the route. If the JWT is invalid, the user will be denied access
to the route.

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')

const verifyJWT = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization || req.headers.Authorization
  //If there is not token send from request then status 401 unauthorized
  if (!authHeader?.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    // console.log("hell")
    return res.sendStatus(401)
  }
  const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1]
  console.log(token)
  jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403) //invalid token
    req.username = decoded.username
    next()
  })
}

module.exports = verifyJWT
```

- Another custom middleware is `credentials.js` which uses the allowedOrigins array to check if the origin of the request is allowed or not. If the origin is
  not allowed, the request will be denied. If the origin is allowed, the request will be allowed to continue. This will take place before CORS is enabled.

```js
const allowedOrigins = require('../config/allowedOrigins')

const credentials = (req, res, next) => {
  const origin = req.headers.origin
  if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true)
  }
  next()
}

module.exports = credentials
```

- Now, we need to import the `verifyJWT` function into our `server.js` file and use it as a middleware function. This will verify the JWT sent in the request
  header before allowing the user to access the route. Also import the `credentials` middleware function and use it as a middleware function. This will
  allow the user to access the route if the origin of the request is allowed.

```js
const verifyJWT = require('./middleware/verifyJWT')
const credentials = require('./middleware/credentials')

app.use(verifyJWT)
app.use(credentials)
```

- Finally an option middleware that we will use is the middleware which checks for urlencoded form data. This is used to parse the request body if the
  content-type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

```js
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))
```

- So thesea are the middleware that we have used in our project. You can add more middleware functions to your project as per your requirements.

## Mongo DB Schema

- Before we start creating the routes, we need to create a schema for our MongoDB database. We will be using the `mongoose` package to create the schema.
- Create a `models` directory in the root of your project. In this directory, we will create a `User.js` file. This file will contain the schema for our
  users collection.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const Schema = mongoose.Schema

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: false,
    //unique: true,
  },
  fullname: {
    type: String,
    required: false,
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    //unique: true,
  },
  date: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
  color: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  image: {
    file: {
      path: String,
    },
  },

  boards: [
    {
      _id: false,
      bid: {
        type: String,
        ref: 'boards',
      },
      isFavourite: {
        type: Boolean,
        default: false,
      },
    },
  ],

  notification: [
    {
      notify_type: String,
      boardName: String,
      userName: String,
      sendTime: String,
      uid: String,
      bid: String,
      accept: String,
    },
  ],
  refreshToken: [String],
})

module.exports = User = mongoose.model('user', UserSchema)
```

### Breakdown of the schema

This will look confusing at first, but we will break it down one by one.

- The `username` field is the username of the user. This field is not required. This field is not unique. This field is of type `String`.
- The `fullname` field is the fullname of the user. This field is not required. This field is of type `String`.
- The `password` field is the password of the user. This field is required. This field is of type `String`.
- The `email` field is the email of the user. This field is required. This field is unique. This field is of type `String`.
- The `date` field is the date when the user was created. This field is of type `Date`.
- The `color` field is the color of the user. This field is required. This field is of type `String`.
- The `image` field is the image of the user. This field is of type `Object`. This field has a `file` field which is of type `Object`. This field has a
  `path` field which is of type `String`.
- The `boards` field is an array of objects. This field is of type `Array`. This field has a `_id` field which is of type `Boolean`. This field has a `bid`
  field which is of type `String`. This field has a `isFavourite` field which is of type `Boolean`.
- The `notification` field is an array of objects. This field is of type `Array`. This field has a `notify_type` field which is of type `String`. This
  field has a `boardName` field which is of type `String`. This field has a `userName` field which is of type `String`. This field has a `sendTime` field
  which is of type `String`. This field has a `uid` field which is of type `String`. This field has a `bid` field which is of type `String`. This field has a
  `accept` field which is of type `String`.
- The `refreshToken` field is an array of strings. This field is of type `Array`. This field has a `String` field which is of type `String`.

- Now, we need to create a `Board.js` file in the `models` directory. This file will contain the schema for our boards collection.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const Schema = mongoose.Schema

const BoardSchema = new Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  lists: [
    {
      _id: false,
      list: {
        type: String,
      },
    },
  ],

  backgroundURL: {
    type: String,
  },

  members: [
    {
      _id: false,
      user: {
        type: String,
        ref: 'users',
      },
    },
  ],
})

module.exports = Board = mongoose.model('board', BoardSchema)
```

### Important Note

- The `ref` field in the `members` field is the name of the collection that we want to reference. In this case, we want to reference the `users` collection.
- The `ref` field in the `boards` field is the name of the collection that we want to reference. In this case, we want to reference the `boards` collection.

### Breakdown of the schema

- The `title` field is the title of the board. This field is required. This field is of type `String`.
- The `lists` field is an array of objects. This field is of type `Array`. This field has a `_id` field which is of type `Boolean`. This field has a `list`
  field which is of type `String`.
- The `backgroundURL` field is the background image of the board. This field is of type `String`.
- The `members` field is an array of objects. This field is of type `Array`. This field has a `_id` field which is of type `Boolean`. This field has a
  `user` field which is of type `String`.

- Using these schemas, we can create the routes for our project. You can add more fields to the schema as per your requirements. And for the purpose of
  this tutorial, we will be using the `User.js` and `Board.js` files.

## Routes

- Now, we will create the routes for our project. We will be using the `express` package to create the routes.
- Create a `routes` directory in the root of your project. In this directory, we will create a `api` directory. In this directory, we will create a
  `auth.js` file. This file will contain the routes for authentication. When a user registers or logs in, we will use these routes. Here we will use another
  package called `bcryptjs` to hash the password. We will also use the `jsonwebtoken` package to generate the token for the user. We will also use the
  `config` package to get the secret key for the token. Also we will be using `multer` package to upload the image of the user.

- Let's start with uploading the image of the user. We will create a `multer` instance and export it. This instance will be used in the `auth.js` file.

### Upload Image

```js
const express = require('express')
const User = require('../../models/User')
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt')
const multer = require('multer')
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')

const router = express.Router()

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, 'images')
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, new Date().toISOString() + file.originalname)
  },
})

const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  const fileTypesAllowed = ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png']

  //check whether filetype allowed is acceptable
  if (fileTypesAllowed.includes(file.mimetype)) {
    cb(null, true)
  } else {
    cb(null, false)
  }
}

const upload = multer({
  storage: storage,
  limits: {
    fileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 5,
  },
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
})
```

### Sign up route

- Now, we will create the routes for the authentication. We will create a `POST` route for registering the user.

```js
router.post('/signup', profile.single('pic'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    //check if user already exist
    const fetched_user = await User.find({
      $or: [{ email: req.body.email }, { username: req.body.username }],
    })
    if (fetched_user.length != 0) {
      console.log(fetched_user)
      return res.status(500).json('User already exist')
    }
    if (req.file) {
      const cryptsalt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10)
      const hashedpass = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, cryptsalt)
      const new_user = await new User({
        email: req.body.email,
        username: req.body.username,
        password: hashedpass,
        color: req.body.color,
        image: {
          file: {
            path: req.file.path,
          },
        },
      })

      const result = await new_user.save()
      res.status(200).json(result)
    } else {
      const cryptsalt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10)
      const hashedpass = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, cryptsalt)
      const new_user = await new User({
        email: req.body.email,
        username: req.body.username,
        password: hashedpass,
        color: req.body.color,
      })

      const result = await new_user.save()
      res.status(200).json(result)
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
    res.status(500).json(err)
  }
})
```

### Breakdown of the sign up route

- We will first check if the user already exists. If the user already exists, we will return an error. If the user does not exist, we will create a new
  user.
- We will use the `multer` instance to upload the image of the user. If the image is uploaded, we will create a new user with the image. If the image is
  not uploaded, we will create a new user without the image.
- We will use the `bcrypt` package to hash the password. We will use the `genSalt` function to generate the salt. We will use the `hash` function to
  hash the password. We will use the `10` as the salt rounds.
- We will create a new user with the hashed password. We will also use the `color` field to set the color of the user.
- We will use the `save` function to save the user to the database. If the user is saved successfully, we will return the user. If there is an error, we
  will return the error.

### Login route

- Now, we will create the `POST` route for logging in the user.

```js
outer.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    //Assuming there is old cookies
    const cookies = req.cookies

    const user = await User.findOne({
      email: req.body.email,
    })
    !user && res.status(404).json('User not found')

    const validPass = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password)
    !validPass && res.status(400).json('Wrong Password')
    //Create the JWT
    const accessToken = jwt.sign(
      {
        username: user.username,
      },
      process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,
      { expiresIn: '5m' }
    )
    //create refresh token
    const refreshToken = jwt.sign({ username: user.username }, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, {
      expiresIn: '1d',
    })

    //If there is old refresh token
    //eg: user goes to login without logging out
    //we will delete the old refresh token
    let newRefreshTokenArray = !cookies?.jwt
      ? user.refreshToken
      : user.refreshToken.filter((rt) => rt !== cookies?.jwt)
    if (cookies?.jwt) {
      const Token = cookies.jwt
      const foundToken = await User.findOne({ Token })

      // Detected refresh token reuse!
      if (!foundToken) {
        // clear out ALL previous refresh tokens
        newRefreshTokenArray = []
      }
      res.clearCookie('jwt', {
        httpOnly: true,
        sameSite: 'none',
        secure: true,
      })
    }

    // Add new refresh token to user
    user.refreshToken = [...newRefreshTokenArray, refreshToken]
    const result = await user.save()
    //Send new refresh token
    res.cookie('jwt', refreshToken, {
      httpOnly: true,
      sameSite: 'none',
      secure: true,
      maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
    }) // set secure to true when its in production

    // Send authorization roles and access token to user
    res.status(200).json({ result, accessToken })
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
})
```

### Breakdown of the login route

- We will first check if the user exists. If the user does not exist, we will return an error. If the user exists, we will check if the password is correct.
- We will use the `bcrypt` package to compare the password. We will use the `compare` function to compare the password. We will use the `password` from the
  database and the `password` from the request body.
- We will create the `accessToken` and the `refreshToken`. We will use the `sign` function to create the token. We will use the `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` and
  the `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` from the `.env` file. We will use the `expiresIn` to set the expiration time of the token.
- We will check if there is an old refresh token. If there is an old refresh token, we will filter out the old refresh token from the array. If there is no
  old refresh token, we will use the `refreshToken` array from the database.
- We will add the new refresh token to the array. We will use the `save` function to save the user to the database.
- We will send the new refresh token to the user. We will use the `cookie` function to set the cookie. We will use the `httpOnly` to set the cookie to be
  accessible only by the web server. We will use the `sameSite` to set the cookie to be sent only in a first-party context. We will use the `secure` to set
  the cookie to be sent only in HTTPS. We will use the `maxAge` to set the expiration time of the cookie.
- We will send the `accessToken` and the `refreshToken` to the user.

> Pro Tip: We will check for refresh token reuse. If the refresh token is reused, we will clear out all the previous refresh tokens. We will also clear the
> cookie. We will use the `clearCookie` function to clear the cookie.

### Logout route

- Now, we will create the `POST` route for logging out the user.

```js
router.post('/logout', async (req, res) => {
  // On client, also delete the accessToken

  const cookies = req.cookies
  if (!cookies?.jwt) return res.sendStatus(204) //No content
  const refreshToken = cookies.jwt

  // Is user in db?
  // If not, delete the cookie
  const foundUser = await User.findOne({ refreshToken })
  if (!foundUser) {
    res.clearCookie('jwt', { httpOnly: true, sameSite: 'none', secure: true })
    return res.sendStatus(204)
  }

  // Delete refreshToken in db
  foundUser.refreshToken = foundUser.refreshToken.filter((rt) => rt !== refreshToken)
  const result = await foundUser.save()
  console.log(result)

  res.clearCookie('jwt', { httpOnly: true, sameSite: 'none', secure: true })
  res.sendStatus(200)
})

module.exports = router
```

### Breakdown of the logout route

- We will first check if there is a refresh token. If there is no refresh token, we will return `204` status code. If there is a refresh token, we will
  check if the refresh token is in the database.
- We will use the `findOne` function to find the user. We will use the `refreshToken` from the cookie.
- If the refresh token is not in the database, we will clear the cookie. We will use the `clearCookie` function to clear the cookie. We will use the
  `httpOnly` to set the cookie to be accessible only by the web server. We will use the `sameSite` to set the cookie to be sent only in a first-party context.
  We will use the `secure` to set the cookie to be sent only in HTTPS.
- If the refresh token is in the database, we will filter out the refresh token from the array. We will use the `save` function to save the user to the
  database.
- Finally we will clear out the cookies and return `200` status code.

> So the three situations are:
>
> - If there is no refresh token, we will return `204` status code.
> - If there is a refresh token but it is not in the database, we will clear the cookie and return `204` status code.
> - If there is a refresh token and it is in the database, we will filter out the refresh token from the array and save the user to the database. We will
>   clear the cookie and return `200` status code.

- Clearing out the cookie even if the user with the refresh token exist in the database is to prevent the user from automatically logging in again after logging out.
- And obviously, if the refresh token exists, but the user does not exist, we will clear the cookie. This is a security measure to prevent the a hacker
  from logging in as a user. If the hacker has the refresh token, he can still log in as the user. So we need to check if the user exists with the refresh token.

### User route

We will now see some basic CRUD operations. We will create a user route. We will create a `GET` route to get all the users.
We will create a `PUT` route to update a user. We will create a `DELETE` route to delete a user. We have already seen
how to create a user through sign up.

1. We will create a `user.js` file in the `routes` folder to `Get` all the users.

```js
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()
const multer = require('multer')

const User = require('../models/User')

// GET user
router.get('/getuser', (req, res) => {
  User.find()
    .sort({ date: -1 })
    .then((users) => res.json(users))
})
```

- We will create a `GET` route to get all the users. We will use the `find` function to find all the users. We will use the `sort` function to sort the users
  by the date. We will use the `date` from the database. We will use the `-1` to sort the users in descending order. We will use the `then` function to get the
  users. We will use the `json` function to send the users as a JSON response.

2. We will create a `PUT` route to update a user. This example is about updating the profile picture of the user.

```js
router.put('/:id', profile.single('pic'), async (req, res) => {
  const updates = {
    username: req.body.username,
    image: {
      file: '',
    },
  }
  if (req.file) {
    updates.image.file = req.file.path
  }
  try {
    const user = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, updates, { new: true })
    res.status(200).json('Profile Updated Succesfully')
  } catch (e) {
    return res.status(500).json(err)
  }
})
```

- We will use the `findByIdAndUpdate` function to update the user. We will use the `req.params.id` to get the id of the user. We will use the `updates` to
  update the user. We will use the `new: true` to return the updated user. We will use the `json` function
  to send the updated user as a JSON response.

3. We will `GET` route to get a user by id.

```js
// get user profile
router.post('/find_user', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const users = await User.find()
    matching_users = []
    for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
      const userId = users[i].id.slice(17)
      if (userId === req.body.uid) {
        matching_users.push(users[i])
      }
    }
    res.status(200).json(matching_users)
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err)
  }
})
```

- We will use the `find` function to find all the users. We will use the `for` loop to loop through the users. We will use the `slice` function to get the last 17
  characters of the id. We will use the `if` statement to check if the id is equal to the id from the request.
- We will use the `push` function to push the user to the `matching_users` array. We will use the `json` function to send the `matching_users` array as a JSON
  response.

4. We will create a `DELETE` route to delete a user.

```js
// delete user

router.delete('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(req.params.id)
    try {
      await user.deleteOne()
      res.status(200).json('User has been deleted...')
    } catch (err) {
      res.status(500).json(err)
    }
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err)
  }
})
```

- We will use the `findById` function to find the user. We will use the `deleteOne` function to delete the user. We will use the `json` function to send the
  message as a JSON response.

### Refresh token route

This route is to refresh the access token. We will create a `refreshToken.js` file in the `routes` folder.

```js
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const cookies = req.cookies
  // console.log(cookies.jwt)
  if (!cookies?.jwt) return res.sendStatus(401) //unauthorized
  const refreshToken = cookies.jwt
  // Delete after one use
  res.clearCookie('jwt', { httpOnly: true, sameSite: 'none', secure: true })

  //Detected refresh token that is reused again!!
  //handling token misuse
  const current_user = await User.findOne({ refreshToken })
  if (!current_user) {
    // console.log("don't have refresh", current_user)
    jwt.verify(refreshToken, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, async (err, decoded) => {
      if (err) return res.sendStatus(403) //Forbidden
      // Delete refresh tokens of hacked user
      const hackedUser = await User.findOne({ username: decoded.username }).exec()
      hackedUser.refreshToken = []
      const result = await hackedUser.save()
    })
    return res.sendStatus(403) //Forbidden
  }

  const newRefreshTokenArray = current_user.refreshToken.filter((rt) => rt !== refreshToken)

  jwt.verify(refreshToken, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, async (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      //refresh token has expired handling.
      // console.log("Expired!!")
      current_user.refreshToken = [...newRefreshTokenArray]
      const result = await current_user.save()
    }
    // refresh token is wrong.
    // console.log(decoded.username)
    if (err || current_user.username !== decoded.username) {
      // console.log("I was here", newRefreshTokenArray)
      return res.sendStatus(403)
    }
    // Refresh token was still valid

    //set new accessToken
    const accessToken = jwt.sign({ username: decoded.username }, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, {
      expiresIn: '5m',
    })
    //renew with new refresh token
    const newRefreshToken = jwt.sign(
      { username: current_user.username },
      process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET,
      { expiresIn: '1d' }
    )

    current_user.refreshToken = [...newRefreshTokenArray, newRefreshToken]
    const result = await current_user.save()

    // Creates Secure Cookie with refresh token
    res.cookie('jwt', newRefreshToken, {
      httpOnly: true,
      sameSite: 'none',
      secure: true,
      maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
    })

    res.json({ accessToken })
  })
})
```

That was a lot to take in, so let's break it down as simple as possible.

So first off, the main use of refresh token route, is so that there is a security layer, so that only authenticate users can access the protected routes.
So every API call by the user, will have to go through the refresh token route, to get a new access token if the access token has expired. So the user will
have to send the refresh token in the request, and the refresh token route will check if the refresh token is valid, and if it is valid, it will send a new
access token to the user. So the user will have to send the new access token in the request, to access the protected routes.

This is how the refresh token route works. And it's a very simple concept, but it's very important to understand.

So let's break down the code.

- First we will check if the client request has `refresh token`. If it doesn't have the `refresh token` in the cookie, we will send a `401` status code, which means unauthorized.
- We will get the refresh token from the `jwt` cookie and store it in the `refreshToken` variable if it exists.
- We will clear the `jwt` cookie, so that the refresh token can only be used once.
- We will use the `findOne` function to find the user with the refresh token. If the user doesn't exist, we will use the `verify` function to verify the refresh
  token. If the refresh token is invalid, we will send a `403` status code, which means forbidden. Such situations can happen when the refresh token is stolen
  by a hacker. So we will use the `findOne` function to find the user with the username from the refresh token and clear the refresh token array.
- If that is not the case, the we will create a new refresh token array, and we will use the `filter` function to filter out the refresh token from the array.
- We will use the `verify` function to verify the refresh token. There are 2 cases here.
  - If the refresh token has expired just now, we will use the `save` function to save the new refresh token array to the user.
  - If the refresh token has expired and decoded user is not the same as the user with the refresh token, we will send a `403` status code, which means
    forbidden. This can happen when the refresh token is stolen by a hacker. So we will use the `save` function to save the new refresh token array to the user.
- If the refresh token is valid, we will create a new access token, and we will use the `sign` function to sign the access token. We will use the `json` function
  to send the access token as a JSON response.
- We will create a new refresh token, and we will use the `sign` function to sign the refresh token. We will use the `save` function to save the new refresh token
  to the user.
- We will create a secure cookie with the new refresh token, and we will use the `cookie` function to set the cookie. We will use the `json` function to send the
  access token as a JSON response.

## Conclusion

Wow, that was quite the journey! We've covered everything from setting up a MongoDB Atlas cluster, to using Mongoose to cook up a user model,
and even adding some middleware and routes to our ExpressJS backend.

But wait, there's more! Stay tuned for our next post where I'll show you how to create asynchronous API calls with axios, and top it off with a wrapper to
access protected routes and use our refreshing refresh token route to get a new access token when the old one has expired.

Thanks for reading and I hope you found this information as satisfying as a warm bowl of your favorite soup. And don't hesitate to reach out to us with
any questions, I're always happy to help!
