# What is Django and GraphQL?

Django is a powerful web framework for building web applications using the Python programming language.
GraphQL is a query language for your API that allows clients to request exactly the data they need,
making it a great choice for building a flexible and efficient backend for your project.
In this post, we'll walk through the steps of setting up a Django-GraphQL backend for your
project.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3
- pip (the package manager for Python)
- virtualenv (to create a isolated Python environment for your project)

## Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

The first step is to create a virtual environment for your project. This will allow you to keep
your project's dependencies separate from the global Python environment, making it easier to manage
and deploy.

To create a virtual environment, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
Then run the following command:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

This will create a new directory called `myenv` in your current directory, which will contain the isolated Python
environment for your project. To activate the environment, run the following command:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with the name of your environment (e.g., "(myenv) $").

## Step 2: Install Django and Graphene

With your virtual environment active, you can now install the required packages for your project.
To install Django and graphql and graphql-jwt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install django graphene-django graphql-jwt
```

## Step 3: Create a Django Project

With Django installed, you can now create a new project. In your terminal, navigate to the
directory where you want to create your project and run the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject framework
```

This will create a new directory called `framework` in your current directory,
which will contain the files for your Django project.

## Step 4: Create a Django App

With your Django project created, you can now create a new app to contain your
GraphQL functionality. Each app will be a module which consist of specific functionality.
We are splitting up the project into different app module for the each of development and
maintaining a clean codebase.

For e.g; let the first app module that of `user`. In your terminal, navigate to the directory of your project
and run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py startapp user
```

This will create a new directory called `user` in your current directory,

## Step 5: Configure Django Settings

With your app created, you can now configure your Django settings. Open the `framework/settings.py` file in your
project and add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'graphene_django',
    'user',
]
```

This will add the `graphene_django` and `user` apps to your project.

## Step 6: Create a GraphQL Schema

From the projects that I have worked with Django and GraphQL, I have found that the best way is to create a
root schema.py in project directory i.e; `framework` directory. This will contain all the schema for the
different app modules, including the Query and Mutation classes. This provides an easy management of the
schema, and grapql APIs for the project.

In the `framework\schema.py` file, add the following:

```python
import graphene
import graphql_jwt
from user.graphql.query import UserQuery
from user.graphql.mutations import Mutation as UserMutation


class Query(UserQuery, graphene.ObjectType):
    pass


class Mutation(UserMutation,
               graphene.ObjectType):
    token_auth = graphql_jwt.ObtainJSONWebToken.Field()
    verify_token = graphql_jwt.Verify.Field()
    refresh_token = graphql_jwt.Refresh.Field()


schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query, mutation=Mutation)
```

Now in the `framework\settings.py` file, add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
GRAPHENE = {
    'SCHEMA': 'framework.schema.schema',
    'MIDDLEWARE': [
        'graphql_jwt.middleware.JSONWebTokenMiddleware',
    ],
}
```

Now you might be wondering what is Query and Mutation and how are they used. Well, Query is used to fetch
data from the database and Mutation is used to create, update and delete data from the database.
In the above code, we have imported the Query and Mutation classes from the `user` app module.
We have also imported the `graphql_jwt` package, which will allow us to use JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
We will understand about how to create Query and Mutation in the next steps.

## Step 7: GraphQL Endpoint

Now that we have created a GraphQL schema, we can create a GraphQL endpoint to access it.
In the `framework\urls.py` file, add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
from graphene_django.views import GraphQLView

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('graphql', csrf_exempt(GraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True))),
]
```

This will add a GraphQL endpoint to your project at `http://localhost:8000/graphql`.

## Step 8: Create a GraphQL Query

I have come to follow a principle of creating `4` folders for an app module under `graphql` directory to
create the API endpoints. They are:

- `inputs` - This folder will contain the input classes for the mutations.
- `mutations` - This folder will contain the mutation classes.
- `query` - This folder will contain the query classes.
- `types` - This folder will contain the type classes.

> HACK => Each of the above folders will contain a `__init__.py` file, which will contain the imports for the classes.

- This again, helps to manage the codebase and also helps to understand the codebase easily.

Now that we have created a GraphQL endpoint, we can create a GraphQL query to access it. Before that we have to create
user model. In the `user\models.py` file, add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

class User(AbstractUser):
    id = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True, null=False)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, null=False, blank=False)
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=15, blank=True, null=True)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=255, default='', blank=True, verbose_name='First Name')
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=255, default='', blank=True, verbose_name='Last Name')

```

You can add more fields to the user model as per your requirement. Since this will be the new `User` model, which would
rewrite the existing django backend `User` we need to specify it in settings.py. In the `framework\settings.py` file,
add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'user.User'
```

- After that register the `User` model in `user\admin.py` file.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import User

@admin.register(User)
class UserAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ##show how each object will be listed
    list_display = ['username', 'date_joined']
    ##show filters
    list_filter = [
        'is_active', 'is_staff', 'gender', 'date_joined'
    ]
    ##seach fields
    search_fields = ['username', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email']
```

Now we can create a GraphQL query to access the user model. In the `user\graphql\query\users.py` file,
add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
import graphene
from user.models import User
from user.graphql.types import UserBasicObj

class UserQuery(graphene.ObjectType):
    users = graphene.List(UserBasicObj)

    def resolve_users(self, info):
        return User.objects.all()
```

### Explanation

- `UserQuery` is a class which inherits from `graphene.ObjectType`. This is a class which is used to create a GraphQL query.
- `users` is a field which is of type `graphene.List(UserBasicObj)`. This field will return a list of `UserBasicObj` type.
- `resolve_users` is a method which is used to resolve the `users` field. This method will return all the users from the database.
  `resolvers` are used to resolve the fields in a GraphQL query.
- `graphene.List` is a class which is used to create a list of a particular type.

> HACK => You can also create a query to fetch a single user by specifying the `id` of the user.

```python
import graphene
from user.models import User
from user.graphql.types import UserBasicObj

class UserQuery(graphene.ObjectType):
    users = graphene.List(UserBasicObj)
    user = graphene.Field(UserBasicObj, id=graphene.ID())

    def resolve_users(self, info):
        return User.objects.all()

    def resolve_user(self, info, **kwargs):
        id = kwargs.get('id')
        return User.objects.get(id=id)
```

> NOTE:
> graphene is a python library which is used to create GraphQL schemas. There are different types of fields which can be
> created in a GraphQL schema. They are: `graphene.Field`, `graphene.List`, `graphene.NonNull`, `graphene.String`,
> `graphene.Int`, `graphene.Boolean`, `graphene.Float`, `graphene.ID`, `graphene.DateTime`, `graphene.Decimal` etc.
> According to the requirement of the model structure, you can use any of the above fields to create a GraphQL schema.
> In this case, we needed to create a list of users, so we used `graphene.List` field. If we needed to create a single
> user, we would have used `graphene.Field` field.

We have to also create a GraphQL type for the user model. In the `user\graphql\types\users.py` file,
add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
import graphene
from user.models import User

class UserBasicObj(
    graphene.ObjectType,
    description='the user type'
):
    id = graphene.ID()
    firstName = graphene.String()
    lastName = graphene.String()
    email = graphene.String()

    def resolve_id(self, info):
        if isinstance(self, User):
            return self.id

    def resolve_firstName(self, info):
        if isinstance(self, User):
            return self.first_name

    def resolve_lastName(self, info):
        if isinstance(self, User):
            return self.last_name

    def resolve_email(self, info):
        if isinstance(self, User):
            return self.email

```

Now we can access the user model using the GraphQL query. Open the GraphQL
endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/graphql` and run the following query:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    firstName
    lastName
    email
  }
}
```

- Let's check a sample input of the above query:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "email": "test@gmail.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

PRO TIP => If the query or mutation classes get too big, you can split them
into multiple files and import them in the `__init__.py` file. For example in
the `user\graphql\query.py` file, add the following lines to the end of the
`user\graphql\query\__init__.py` file:

```python
from .user import UserQuery

__all__ = [
    'UserQuery',
    ## add more queries here
]

```

## Step 9: Create a GraphQL Mutation

### Create input structure for user creation

Now we can create a GraphQL mutation to create a user. In the `user\graphql\inputs\users.py` file,
add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
import graphene
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType
from user.models import User

class UserCreateInput(graphene.InputObjectType):
    username = graphene.String(required=True)
    email = graphene.String(required=True)
    password = graphene.String(required=True)
    firstName = graphene.String(required=True)
    lastName = graphene.String(required=True)
```

### Create user creation class

Now we can create a GraphQL mutation to create a user. In the `user\graphql\mutations\users.py` file,
add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
import graphene
from user.models import User
from user.graphql.inputs import UserCreateInput
from user.graphql.types import UserBasicObj

class UserCreationResponse(graphene.ObjectType):
    success = graphene.Boolean()
    returning = graphene.Field(UserBasicObj)


class CreateUser(graphene.Mutation,
                 description='create a user'):
    class Arguments:
        inputs = graphene.Argument(userCreationInput,
                                   required=True,
                                   description='inputs available for creation')
        password = graphene.String(required=True)
        username = graphene.String(required=True)

    Output = UserCreationResponse

    def mutate(self, info, inputs: userCreationInput, password, username):
        user = User.objects.create(
            username=input.username,
            email=input.email,
            first_name=input.firstName,
            last_name=input.lastName,
        )
        user.set_password(input.password)
        user.save()
        return UserCreationResponse(success=True, returning=user)
```

I have come to follow the convention of returning a response object with a certain structure. here the structure
is as follows:

```python
class UserCreationResponse(graphene.ObjectType):
    success = graphene.Boolean()
    returning = graphene.Field(UserBasicObj)
```

The `success` field will be `True` if the mutation was successful and `False` otherwise. The `returning` field will
contain the object that was created. In this case, it will be the user object. This will be useful when we want to
return the newly created object in the response. Which will be more useful in the frontend as well as graphql playground,
wheich would provide us with a well-structured response. Which could then be destructured as per the need.

### Register the mutation

Now we can register the mutation in the `user\graphql\mutations\__init__.py` file, add the following lines to the end of the file:

```python
from .user import CreateUser

class Mutation(graphene.ObjectType):
    createUser = CreateUser.Field()
    ## add more mutations here

__all__ = [
    'Mutation',
]
```

Here we have registered the mutation and also added it to the `__all__` list. This will make it easier to import the mutation.

### Create a GraphQL mutation

Now we can access the user model using the GraphQL mutation. Open the GraphQL
endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/graphql` and run the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(
    inputs: {
      username: "testuser"
      email: "hello@gmail.com"
      password: "testpassword"
      firstName: "test"
      lastName: "user"
    }
  ) {
    success
    returning {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      email
    }
  }
}
```

- This will create a user with the given details and return the newly created user object with the `success` field set to `True`. The
  sample Output with look like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createUser": {
      "success": true,
      "returning": {
        "id": "1",
        "firstName": "test",
        "lastName": "user",
        "email": "hello@gmail.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- If the mutation fails, the `success` field will be set to `False` and the `returning` field will be `null`. The sample output will look like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createUser": {
      "success": false,
      "returning": null
    }
  }
}
```

## To Sum up

In this post, we have learned how to setup a base django-graphql backend framework project to build GraphQL API endpoints. we have learned how to create a
GraphQL API using Django and graphene. We have also learned how to create a GraphQL query and mutation. We have also learned how to create a GraphQL input object and how to use it in the mutation.
We have also learned how to create a GraphQL response object and how to use it in the mutation and certain principles to follow will be useful while developing
the GraphQL APIs. From this base setup and principles we can build robust GraphQL APIs for our frontend applications like React, Vue, Angular, NextJS, etc.
