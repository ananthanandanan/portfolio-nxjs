# Azure ACR 101

Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed Docker registry service provided by Azure for storing and managing your private Docker container images and other artifacts. It's based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0.

In this blog, we will guide you through the process of building, pushing, and pulling an image using Azure ACR.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed on your machine.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.

## Login to Azure

First, you need to login to your Azure account and set your subscription.

```bash
az login
az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
```

## Create a resource group and a registry

Create a resource group and a registry.

```bash
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myRegistry --sku Basic
```

## Build image

Now, you can build an image and push it to the registry.

```bash
az acr build --image sample/hello-world:v1 --registry myRegistry --file Dockerfile .
```

> NOTE: You can also use the `docker build -t` command to build and tag the image.

```bash
docker build -t myRegistry.azurecr.io/sample/hello-world:v1 .
```

## Push image

Push the image to the registry.

```bash
az acr push --image sample/hello-world:v1 --registry myRegistry
```

or you can use the `docker push` command to push the image.

```bash
docker push myRegistry.azurecr.io/sample/hello-world:v1
```

## Pull image from registry

Finally, you can pull the image from the registry to use it.

```bash
docker pull myRegistry.azurecr.io/sample/hello-world:v1
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You have successfully built, pushed, and pulled an image using Azure ACR. We hope this guide helps you understand the process better and encourages you to explore more with Azure ACR.
