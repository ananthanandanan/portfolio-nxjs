In the previous blog, I had discussed about TRPC, a new RPC framework for TypeScript. In this blog, I will be walking through the basics of Prisma ORM,
everything you need to know to get started with it and use it in your projects.

# What is Prisma?

Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes database access easy with an auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js and TypeScript. It is a
database toolkit that consists of three main components:

- Prisma Client: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js and TypeScript
- Prisma Migrate: Declarative data modeling and migrations
- Prisma Studio: GUI to view and edit data in your database

## Getting Started

### PlanetScale

Prisma supports a wide range of databases, but for this tutorial, we will be using PlanetScale, a MySQL compatible database. PlanetScale is a cloud
database platform that provides a fully managed MySQL compatible database service.

To get started, you can sign up for a free account at [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/). Once you have signed up, you can create a new database
cluster. You can name the cluster anything you want, and choose the region closest to you.

### Dependencies

- Create a project directory and initialize a new npm project.

```bash
mkdir prisma-tut
cd prisma-tut
npm init -y
```

- Install the Prisma CLI as a dev dependency. And other necessary dependencies.

```bash
npm i --save-dev prisma typescript ts-node @types/node nodemon
```

### initialize Prisma

- Initialize Prisma in your project directory.

```bash
npx prisma init --datasource-provider mysql
```

> As you can see, I provided the datasource as `mysql`. Since in planetscale I configured a MySQL database.

> Note: For good intellesense support for prisma in vscode, use the prisma extension.

After that paste the Database URL from PlanetScale to the `.env` file.

## Prisma Schema

Prisma Schema is a declarative language that allows you to define your application models and their relations. It is used to define the data model of your
application.

- So let's start by creating a simple "User" model in the `schema.prisma` file.

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider     = "mysql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  relationMode = "prisma"
}

model User {
  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String
}
```

- Now, we need the database to reflect the changes we made in the schema. So, we need to migrate the database.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

> Note: Funny thing is for PlanetScale, you can't use the migrate command. Because PlanetScale has certain system
> setup for migration file tracking in their workflow.

So instead use the below command:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

- Now to be able to use the schema in our code, we need to install the Prisma Client.

```bash
npm i @prisma/client
```

- Now, we can use the Prisma Client to interact with the database.

To regenerate the Prisma Client, run the following command:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## CRUD Operations

### Create

- Let's create a new user in the database.

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name: 'John Doe',
    },
  })

  console.log(users)
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e.message)
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

This will create a new user in the database with the name "John Doe".

### Read

- Let's say we want to get all the users from the database.

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()

  console.log(users)
}
```

This will return all the users from the database.

## Model Fields

### Field Attributes

There are a lot of different types of field attributes that you can use in your models. They are:

- **@id**: This field is used to define the primary key of the model.
- **@default**: This field is used to define the default value of the field.
- **@unique**: This field is used to define the field as unique.
- **@map**: This field is used to define the name of the field in the database.
- **@relation**: This field is used to define the relation between two models.
- **@ignore**: This field is used to ignore the field in the database.
- **@updatedAt**: This field is used to define the field as updated at.
- **@uuid**: This field is used to define the field as uuid.
- **@@index**: This field is used to define the index of the field in the database. This is a block-level attribute.
- **@@unique**: This field is used to define the field as unique in the database. This is a block-level attribute.

### Field Type

There are a lot of different types of field types that you can use in your models. They are:

- `String`: This field is used to define a string field.
- `Int`: This field is used to define an integer field.
- `Float`: This field is used to define a float field.
- `Boolean`: This field is used to define a boolean field.
- `DateTime`: This field is used to define a date time field.
- `Json`: This field is used to define a json field.
- `Bytes`: This field is used to define a bytes field.
- `Decimal`: This field is used to define a decimal field.
- `BigInt`: This field is used to define a big integer field.
- `Enum`: This field is used to define an enum field.
- `Unsupported`: This field is used to define an unsupported field.

There are also different varients for each of these types based on the database you are using. You can check them out in the [Prisma Docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#model-fields).

## Relations

### One-to-Many

- Let's say we want to create a new model called "Post" which has a one-to-many relation with the "User" model.

```prisma
model User {
  id            String  @id @default(uuid())
  name          String
  email         String
  isAdmin       Boolean
  preferences   Json
  writtenPosts  Post[]  @relation("writtenPosts")
  favoritePosts Post[]  @relation("favoritePosts")
}

model Post {
  id            String   @id @default(uuid())
  rating        Float
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime
  author        User     @relation("writtenPosts", fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  authorId      String
  favoritedBy   User?     @relation("favoritePosts", fields: [favoritedById], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  favoritedById String?

  @@index([authorId], name: "authorId")
  @@index([favoritedById], name: "favoritedById")
}
```

- Okay, so a lot of things are going on here. Let's break it down.

- First, we have defined a new model called "Post". It has a one-to-many relation with the "User" model. So, we have defined two fields in the "Post"
  model, "author" and "favoritedBy". Both of these fields have a relation with the "User" model. The "author" field has a relation with the "User" model
  with the name "writtenPosts", and the "favoritedBy" field has a relation with the "User" model with the name "favoritePosts".

> Note: Since we are using two relations with the same model, we need to provide a name for each of the relations. That is why we have provided the
> `writtenPosts` and `favoritePosts` names for the relations to avoid ambiguity.

- So if you want to create a one-to-many relation from `User` to `Post`, the format you want to follow is:

```prisma
author        User     @relation("writtenPosts", fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
authorId      String
```

- And since we are using `relationMode = "prisma"` in the `datasource` block, we need to provide index for the fields that are used in the relation.

```prisma
@@index([authorId], name: "authorId")
```

- The `?` in the `favoritedBy` field means that the field is optional. And `[]` in the `writtenPosts` field means that the field is an array.

- `onDelete: Cascade` means that if the user is deleted, all the posts written by the user will also be deleted.

### Many-to-Many

- Let's say we want to create a new model called "Category" which has a many-to-many relation with the "Post" model.

```prisma
model Category {
  id    String @id @default(uuid())
  name  String
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id            String     @id @default(uuid())
  ....
  ....
  categories    Category[]
}
```

- Constructing a many-to-many relation is pretty simple. You just need to add the model name in the field type. And Prisma will automatically create a
  many-to-many relation between the two models. That is by creating a join table between the two models.

### One-to-One

- Let's say we want to create a new model called "userPreference" which has a one-to-one relation with the "User" model.

```prisma
model User {
  id             String          @id @default(uuid())
  name           String
  email          String
  isAdmin        Boolean
  writtenPosts   Post[]          @relation("writtenPosts")
  favoritePosts  Post[]          @relation("favoritePosts")
  userPreference UserPreference? // one-to-one relation
}

model UserPreference {
  id           String  @id @default(uuid())
  emailUpdates Boolean
  user         User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id]) // one-to-one relation
  userId       String  @unique // one-to-one relation
}
```

- To create a one-to-one relation, you just need to provide the relation in `User` model and `UserPreference` model. Such that
  in `User` unlike in one-to-many relation, you don't need to provide the field as an array. And in `UserPreference` model, you need to provide the
  `userId` field as `unique`.

## Enum

Enum is a special type of datasource generator that allows you to define a set of named constants. Like let's say we know
that the user can have only two roles, "ADMIN" and "USER". So, we can define an enum for the roles.

```prisma
enum Role {
  ADMIN
  USER
}

model User {
  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String
  role Role  @default(USER)
}
```

## Create Operations

To create a new record in the database, you can use the `create` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Ananthan',
    email: 'ananthan@gmail.com',
    age: 20,
    isAdmin: true,
  },
})

console.log(user)
```

- With prisma, you can also use the relations even though those models are not created yet. Prisma will automatically create the relations for you.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Ananthan',
    email: 'ananthan@gmail.com',
    age: 20,
    isAdmin: true,
    userPreference: {
      // one-to-one relation
      create: {
        emailUpdates: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Inlcude

- If you want to view returned relations, you need to use the `include` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Ananthan',
    email: 'ananthan@gmail.com',
    age: 20,
    isAdmin: true,
    userPreference: {
      create: {
        emailUpdates: true,
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    userPreference: true,
  },
})
```

The output would look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "ce9f1204-04df-4094-b055-a7d308ce4fee",
  "name": "Ananthan",
  "age": 20,
  "email": "ananthan@gmail.com",
  "role": "BASIC",
  "isAdmin": true,
  "userPreference": {
    "id": "8b8c1bea-99e8-4937-8278-8f4e65e9c24b",
    "emailUpdates": true,
    "userId": "ce9f1204-04df-4094-b055-a7d308ce4fee"
  }
}
```

### Select

- If you want to view only specific fields, you need to use the `select` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: 'Ananthan',
    email: 'ananthan@gmail.com',
    age: 20,
    isAdmin: true,
    userPreference: {
      create: {
        emailUpdates: true,
      },
    },
  },
  select: {
    name: true,
    userPreference: true,
  },
})

console.log(user)
```

The output would look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Ananthan",
  "userPreference": {
    "id": "8b8c1bea-99e8-4937-8278-8f4e65e9c24b",
    "emailUpdates": true,
    "userId": "ce9f1204-04df-4094-b055-a7d308ce4fee"
  }
}
```

> NOTE: You can only use either `include` or `select` method. You can't use both at the same time.

### CreateMany

- Let's suppose in our application, we want to create multiple users at once. We can use the `createMany` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.createMany({
  data: [
    {
      name: 'Ananthan',
      email: 'ananthan@gmail.com',
      age: 20,
      isAdmin: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'Raj',
      email: 'rajive@gmail.com',
      age: 20,
      isAdmin: false,
    },
  ],
})
console.log(user)
```

## Read Operations

### FindUnique

- To find that one specific record in the database, you can use the `findUnique` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    id: 'ce9f1204-04df-4094-b055-a7d308ce4fee',
  },
})
```

> NOTE: If there is no matching record, it will return `null`.

- Now for our `User` mode, we defined the unique fields as a pair of `age` and `name`. So, we can use that to find the record.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    age_name: {
      age: 20,
      name: 'Ananthan',
    },
  },
})
```

### FindFirst

- We use this method to find the first matching record in the database.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findFirst({
  where: {
    name: 'Ananthan',
  },
})
```

### FindMany

- We use this method to find all the matching records in the database.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Ananthan',
  },
})
```

- You can also use the `distinct` method along with findMany to get the distinct records.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Ananthan',
  },
  distinct: ['name', 'age'],
})
console.log(user)
```

- What this will do is, it will return only the distinct records with the name and age fields.

### Pagination

- You can also use pagination with the `findMany` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Ananthan',
  },
  skip: 1,
  take: 2,
})
console.log(user)
```

### orderBy

We can also do sorting with the `findMany` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    name: 'Ananthan',
  },
  orderBy: {
    age: 'asc',
  },
})
```

## Advanced Queries

### IN Query

- Let's say we want to find all the users with the name "Ananthan" or "Raj". We can use the `in` query.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    name: {
      in: ['Ananthan', 'Raj'],
    },
  },
})
```

- To get the users not in the list, we can use the `notIn` query.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    name: {
      notIn: ['Ananthan', 'Raj'],
    },
  },
})
```

### Comparison Queries

- Similarly, we can also use `lt`, `lte`, `gt`, `gte` queries. Assuming here we are using the `age` field.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    age: {
      lt: 20,
    },
  },
})
```

### String Query

- Let's say we want to find all users that have the pattern of `@gmail.com` in their email. We can use the `contains` query.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: '@gmail.com',
    },
  },
})
```

- Similarly, we can also use `startsWith` and `endsWith` queries.

## Logical Queries

### AND Query

- Let's say we want to find all users with the name "Ananthan" and age less than 20. We can use the `AND` query.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    AND: [
      {
        name: 'Ananthan',
      },
      {
        age: {
          lt: 20,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

### OR Query

- Let's say we want to find all users with the name "Ananthan" or age less than 20. We can use the `OR` query.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      {
        name: 'Ananthan',
      },
      {
        age: {
          lt: 20,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

### NOT Query

- Let's say we want to find all users with the name "Ananthan" and age not less than 20. We can use the `NOT` query.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    NOT: [
      {
        name: 'Ananthan',
      },
      {
        age: {
          lt: 20,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

## Relationship Queries

- Let's say we want to query on our `User` model for the relation `writtenPosts`. In this case for example:

```ts
const user = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    writtenPosts: {
      every: {
        title: 'My First Post',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

- This will return all the users who have written a post with the title "My First Post".

- Similarly, we can also use `some` and `none` queries.

## Update Operations

- To update a record in the database, you can use the `update` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.update({
  where: {
    email: 'ananthan@gmail.com',
  },
  data: {
    email: 'henix@gmail.com',
  },
})
console.log(user)
```

Here, we are updating the email of the user with the email `ananthan@gmail.com` to `henix@gmail.com`. And the `update` method will return the updated
record.

- You can also chain the different query methods I have mentioned above to update the required record. So go fancy with it. 😎

- Some special methods in update are:

* `increment`: This method is used to increment the value of a field by a certain amount.

* `decrement`: This method is used to decrement the value of a field by a certain amount.

* `multiply`: This method is used to multiply the value of a field by a certain amount.

* `divide`: This method is used to divide the value of a field by a certain amount.

### Connect

- Let's assume that we already have a `Post` record in the database. And we want to connect that record to the user. We can use the `connect`
  method.

```ts
const post = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Prisma makes databases easy',
    averageRating: 4.0,
    author: {
      connectOrCreate: {
        where: {
          email: 'ronjacob@gmail.com',
        },
        create: {
          email: 'ronjacob@gmail.com',
          name: 'Ron Jacob',
          age: 22,
          isAdmin: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    author: true,
  },
})
```

- Here, we are connecting the `Post` record to the user with the email `ronjacob@gmail.com` if the user exists. If the user doesn't exist, we are
  creating a new user with the email `ronjacob@gmail.com` and connecting the `Post` record to the newly created user.

> NOTE: You can also use the `disconnect` method to disconnect the record during update.

## Delete Operations

### Delete

- To delete a record in the database, you can use the `delete` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.delete({
  where: {
    email: 'ananthan@gmail.com',
  },
})
```

In this example, we are deleting the user with the email `ananthan@gmail.com`.

### DeleteMany

- To delete multiple records in the database, you can use the `deleteMany` method.

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.deleteMany({
  where: {
    age: {
      lt: 20,
    },
  },
})
```

- Here we are deleting all the users with the age less than 20.

## Conclusion

So, that's it for this blog. I have covered all the basics of Prisma ORM after learning it for a week. I believe this blog will help you get started with
Prisma ORM and use it in your projects. If you want to learn more about Prisma ORM, you can check out the [Prisma Docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/).
